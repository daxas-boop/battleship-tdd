# Battleship TDD

## Overview 
This project was created as part of the curriculum in Javascript Fullstack on The Odin Project.</br>

The hardest project for me till now. At the start seemed to be another easy game but that wasn't goint to be the case. Even though I got a pretty detailed explanation of how to create the starting factories, it was quite tough to get around the logic of placing ships on the gameboard with one space in between and getting the position of where each part of the ship was. But at the end a managed a way to do it, still not sure if it's the best one.</br>
Testing an coding afterwards was pretty straightforward on vanillaJS. But a little bit harder on components and custom hooks from react since it was my first time doing it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
